            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>On a large scale, people who are interested in purchasing unique clothing pieces and secondhand sustainble fashion. A more niche target market are people who collect archive designer pieces.</p>
           
            <p>Their goal is to find and purchase unique vintage designer clothing that you would not find on other sites. Vintage designer, especially archive tends to be one of one and every resell site has different, unique pieces. People who are searching for these different pieces can look to my site for something they may have been searching for from vintage runway collections.</p>
