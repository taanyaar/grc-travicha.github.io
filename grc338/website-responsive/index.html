                    <h3>What is Archive Fashion?</h3>
                    <figcaption>
                        Enter the world of archive fashion. Archive fashion is defined as any piece of clothing taken from a designer's past body of work, but in the last few years it has come to describe specific pieces from historically significant collections.<br><br>Archive clothing is essentially the obsessiveness of stamp collecting, sneakerhead culture, or Pokemon cards but applied to fashion. But unlike the people you find in the lineup outside Supreme or Palace, archival fashion collectors are more interested in the old rather than the new.<br><br>As the entry point into the world of streetwear and high-fashion has become so accessible to many, archive clothing is seen as the last bastion of authenticity in fashion â€“ no one owns a piece of archive fashion without dedicating time and energy researching and hunting for it meaning it requires more than just money to become an archival fashion collector.</figcaption>
