                        The Antwerp Six (or the so-called 6 + 1)—Ann Demeulemeester, Marina Yee, Dries Van Noten, Dirk
                        Van Saene, Dirk Bikkembergs and Walter Van Beirendonck, and of course Martin Margiela who joined
                        his fellows from time to time—all emerged from the fashion department of the Royal Academy of
                        Fine Arts in the 80s and went on to create the best of contemporary Belgian
                        fashion.

                    <h3>Why Issey Miyake’s Legacy Runs Beyond Fashion</h3>

                        <a href = 'https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/why-issey-miyakes-legacy-runs-beyond-fashion'>
                        Emulating the movement and fluidity of the human body, Miyake’s designs subverted the dimensions
                        and materials traditionally associated with fashion. His work transcended not only proportion
                        and form, but also gender, size, and age. As design editor Diana Budds has commented, “There’s a
                        stereotype that the design world’s uniform is anything black. But more aspirationally, it’s
                        anything Issey Miyake.”

                    <p>
                        After establishing his namesake label in 1988, Margiela proceeded to upend fashion industry
                        norms through every facet of his business. Many of the designer’s once-radical innovations, from
                        deconstructed tailoring to upcycled materials, are now fashion lingua franca as the Margiela
                        archives have become a well of inspiration for young
                        labels.https://crfashionbook.com/fashion-g32070490-martin-margiela-most-unconventional-runways-fashion-designer/

                        In the late 1990s, Junya Watanabe shook up the fashion world with his “techno-couture” style. he
                        takes a particularly visionary approach to clothing, combining utility fabrics and avant-garde
                        shapes. In 1999, the garments in one of his collections were made from reversible fabrics with a
                        waterproof side, which was tested on the catwalk with artificial
                        rain.

                        If you ask designer Dries Van Noten what he's learned in his career, he'll tell you it's that he
                        (still) doesn't know that much. Or, at least, that he's got a lot to learn. A constant chase for
                        creativity and unique craftsmanship has sustained the Belgian designer from his days in the
                        Antwerp 6 to now, where after his 100th runway show, he's decided to put all of his work into
                        one place — er,
                        two.
