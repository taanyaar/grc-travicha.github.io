                <p>A jawn can be characterized, as stated by urban dictionary: the most credible source, as "Clothing
                    that is stylish or expensive or both, usually high fashion. It was popularized by the magazine Four
                    Pins that now only exists on Twitter and Instagram after being bought out by Complex." Some funny
                    phrases to also chracterize it in sentence terms include: 'bout to cop some jawnz.
                    Spent my rent money on jawnz and now I'm homeless but extremely stylish and good looking.
                    I am swagged out in my new jawnz.
                </p>
                <p> This paragraph is about to make no sense, I did not type everything just stole a random article.
                    From the increasingly well-documented street style scene outside of Pitti Uomo (it's starting to
                    rival the scene outside any major fashion week venue) to the number of nattily dressed gents we see
                    walking down the street in NYC, there's no question that dudes have been stepping it up in the
                    personal style department.

                    There's even a burgeoning menswear (that's #menswear if you're scrolling through Twitter or Tumblr)
                    clique, comprised of editors at print publications like GQ and Complex as well as bloggers at sites
                    like Four Pins and Selectism and Hypebeast. They are the arbiters of men's style, speakers of the
                    language of #menswear. Yes, they have their own language and we don't understand it at all. Cop some
                    jawns? That dude is sprezzy? Say what?

                    We're not alone. Even editors who are in the thick of it sometimes don't get it.

                    "I honestly have no idea what most of the #menswear jargon means, a fact I've tried to keep hidden
                    all this time," Lucky's John Jannuzzi, who also contributes to Four Pins, told us. "If you pay close
                    attention to my eyes when these terms come up in casual conversation, you will see a fleeting moment
                    of anxiety, confusion and wonder. As I understand it, many of them come from the up-and-coming
                    subculture of hip-hop and/or rap music. Despite my varied cultural pursuits, I have not delved as
                    deeply into this world as I should have. Yet, in efforts to blend in with my surroundings, I often
                    find myself finishing a thought and them simply adding 'tho,' or screaming 'sprezzy' at old
                    Italians. These appear to be common words among the #menswear tribe. Working them into my vernacular
                    feels odd, exhilarating and adventurous to me, in the way a new pair of underwear would feel to
                    Garth Algar."

                <h3>Who is jawns?</h3>
                <p>Jawns is a digital fashion magazine for those looking to explore haute couture fashion by visualizing
                    into the history of what formed it. The Antwerp 6, Issey Miyake, Jean Paul Gautier, Tom Ford and
                    many more inconic designers and groups and their impact on present day fashion. In order to learn
                    about how fashion exists in the present, we must examine how it existed in the past. Wearing clothes
                    is something everyone on the Earth shares in common, therefore the clothes we wear are also impacted
                    by the sociality of life at the time.
                </p>
                <p>There’s a fine line between adding one’s own signature style to a grand house while also remaining
                    sensitive to its history.
                    Fashion archives allow new designers to delve into a past that was very different to the present. It
                    can be used in order to gain some insight into the brands DNA and identity, the construction
                    techniques it employed and the research materials it used to inform the shapes and proportions it
                    became famous for.
                    An attention to detail was bestowed on well-cut, hand-sewn garments that stood the test of time.
                    With so much there to inspire contemporary collections, it’s safe to say that any new designer at
                    the helm visiting any fashion archives would feel like a child in a toy shop.
                    Before contemporary fashion arrived, it was traditional for designers to dress their clients from
                    childhood to death and the intervening years.

                <h3>What is archive fashion?</h3>
                <p>At its most superficial, it’s owning an exceedingly rare piece of designer clothing to stunt in. At
                    its most obsessive, it means becoming an archivist of your favorite designer, researching,
                    collecting and reselling their rarest pieces out of sheer love, and maybe a little bit of
                    one-upmanship. Strictly speaking, archival fashion is any piece of clothing taken from a designer’s
                    past body of work, but in the last few years it has come to describe specific pieces from
                    historically significant menswear collections. Archive clothing is essentially the obsessiveness of
                    stamp collecting, sneakerhead culture, or Pokemon cards but applied to fashion. But unlike the
                    people you find in the lineup outside Supreme or Palace, archival fashion collectors are more
                    interested in the old rather than the new. As the entry point into the world of streetwear and
                    high-fashion has become so accessible to many, archive clothing is seen as the last bastion of
                    authenticity in fashion – no one owns a piece of archive fashion without dedicating time and energy
                    researching and hunting for it meaning it requires more than just money to become an archival
                    fashion collector.

                <p>In reality, what signals that a brand is a ‘key archival fashion brand’ is completely dependent on
                    your tastes and interests. While techwear ninjas may lust after Massimo Osti designed Stone Island
                    or early Acronym pieces, ‘Lo Heads are probably more interested in Polo Ralph Lauren Snow Beach.
                    Though punk collectors search far and wide for Vivienne Westwood’s ‘Seditionaries’ collection, forum
                    members of StyleZeitgeist are more likely to drop serious dollars on Carol Christian Poell or the
                    pre-Nike legal action Rick Owens Geobaskets. Basically, each fashion tribe has its own key
                    designers. While technically all vintage designer clothing could be considered an ‘archive piece’,
                    the term has come to define something more specific than just any piece from a designer’s archive.
                    Rather, an archive piece is usually one of a designer’s ‘greatest hits’ from their back catalog,
                    usually a particularly rare or sought after garment from one of their seminal or career-defining
                    collections.
